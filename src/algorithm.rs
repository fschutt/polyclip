    - If e cannot be connected at any of the ends of any chain
    of C, then a new chain, formed by e, is added to C.
    - If e can be connected to only one chain c of C, then e is
    added to c. If the first and last edges in c are connected,
    then c holds a result polygon and it is moved to R.
    - If e can be connected to two chains c1 and c2 of C, then
    the edges of c2 and e are added to c1, and c2 is removed
    from C. If the first and last edges in c1 are connected
    then c1 is moved to R.
